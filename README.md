# Brain Stroke Prediction Model

### Introduction 

Stroke is a medical disorder in which the blood arteries in the brain are ruptured, causing damage to the brain. When the supply of blood and other nutrients to the brain is interrupted, symptoms might develop.

* The stroke rate in India is much higher than in other developing countries. A small percentage of stroke patients die immediately from the initial trauma. 

* Some of the leading causes that eventually lead to death may be initial ischemic infarction, recurrent ischemic stroke and other vascular or nonvascular causes.
